# .smaller[Motivation (1)]
---
name:motivation


- How electoral systems .hi-slate[_shape_] legislative preference is key to understand the theoretical development of party politics and party competition in the real world. 

--

- Previous studies have proposed a number of potential reasons that explain why legislators position themselves differently under .grey-mid[__different electoral systems__] (e.g., Catalinac 2017) or under specific electoral rules in mixed member systems (e.g., Batto 2012; Jun and Hix 2010; Rich 2014).

--

- Recent decades have seen reforms of electoral systems in East Asian democracies such as Japan, South Korea, Thailand, and Taiwan, transitioning from .grey-mid[__SNTV to SMDs__].

--

- Besides the case studies from Japan, other countries, such as .grey-mid[__Taiwan__], could be used to test these effects.

# .smaller[Theoretical Expectation (1)]
---
name:theoretical-expectation

### .hi-grey[Single Non-Transferable Vote (SNTV): ]

--

- strategic motives for coalition-building (e.g, Cox, Rosenbluth and Thies, 1999), increasing candidates to .ul.hi-slate[__seek personal votes__] (e.g, Carey and Shugart, 1995)
  
--

- .ul.hi-slate[__encourages factionalism__] and .ul.hi-slate[__nurtures money politics__] (e.g, Shugart and Wattenberg, 2001, p.38)
  
--

- legilators' positioning diverge against copatisans (Catalinac, 2016)

---

### .hi-grey[ Single Member District (SMD):]

--

- the combination of plurality rule and a single vote per voter, has the potential to .ul.hi-slate[__diminish intraparty competition__] by restricting the district magnitude to 1  (Barceló and Muraoka, 2018).

--

- where both mainstream parties .ul.hi-slate[converge] with their copartisans (Cox, 1990; Adams, 1996; Catalinac, 2016; Downs,
1990). 

--

- voters may make strategic voting on party labels (Aldrich 2011), legislators sharing similar ideological preferences often form alliances, leveraging  party labels to obtain electoral support (Riker 1982).

---

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### .hi-grey[Expectation:] 

- The transition from SNTV to SMDs reduced the degree of inter party competition between mainstream parties.

- Shifting from the SNTV system to SMDs has led to unify legislators within the same party.

### .hi-grey[Workflow:] 

--

- First, we estimate individual legislator's ideological positions from sessional roll call votes continuously covering .hi-slate[ex-ante and ex-post periods of the reform].

--

- Estimating legislators' positions from 1992 to 2015 and .hi-slate[39-item response theory (IRT) ideal point model], with recursively updated individual priors at each session.

--

- Then, .hi-slate[inter- and intra-party distance of ideological positions] are constructed from the estimated positions.

--

- Finally, regressions are introduce to empirically examine our theoretical expectation.

- Our dataset contains 39 legislative sessions .ul.hi-slate[from 1996 to 2016] and captures the changes in legislative composition before and after institutional shifts, including a range of vote items from .hi-slate[323] to .hi-slate[1,223] and a reduction in the number of seats from __240__ to __160__. 

- Dealing with exceptionally .hi-slate[long] and .hi-slate[wide] datasets: .hi-slate[EM-based ideal point estimation].

# .smaller[Takeaway & Conclusion]
---
name:takeaway


- SMDs did not immediately improve interparty conflicts compared to the SNTV

- instead, the reform temporarily increases disagreements between mainstream parties, leading to a short-term escalation of both intra- and inter-party conflicts.

--

- The effect of the refomr exhibits significant heterogeneity between the KMT and the DPP. 

- This effect was particularly detrimental to members of the Kuomingtang (KMT), as compared to members of the Democratic Progress Party (DPP).

--

- After six years, disagreements between the mainstream parties gradually converged and returned to their pre-reform level.
