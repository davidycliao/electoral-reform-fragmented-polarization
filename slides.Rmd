# .smaller[Implications]

name:puzzles

&nbsp;

- How electoral system shape .hi-slate[legislative preference] is key to understand the theoretical development of party politics and party competition in the real world. 

--

- Previous studies have envisioned a number of potential reasons that explain why legislators position themselves differently under .hi-slate[different electoral systems] (e.g. Catalinac 2017) or electoral rules in mixed member electoral systems (e.g. Batto 2012; Jun and Hix 2010; Rich 2014).

--

- Recent decades saw .hi-slate[reforms of electoral systems] from SNTV to SMDs in East- Asian democracies (i.e. Japan, South Korea and Taiwan). 

---
layout: true
# .smaller[Theoretical Expectation]
---

&nbsp;

- The SNTV allows .hi-slate[the district magnitude to exceed one], which creates incentives for party leaders to nominate more than one candidate to run the election.

--

- Candidates not only compete with  rivalry parties' candidates  but co-partisan candidates. This also creates .hi-slate[intra-party competition] (Cox 1990; Hirano 2006; Ames 2001) as well as encouraging factional and candidate-centered electoral politics (e.g. Batto and Huang 2016; Wu 2003).

--

- The SMDs fixes the district magnitude to one (single member) and is expected to mitigate intra-party competition (Carey and Shugart 1995; Shugart and Wattenberg 2003; André, Freire, and Papp 2014). 

---

&nbsp;

- For example, Catalinac (2017) estimates the ideological positions via scaling Japanese election manifestos and demonstrated that .hi-slate[candidates under SNTV positioned themselves against their party].

--

- Catalinac (2016) finds that Liberal Democratic Party candidates in SMDs .hi-slate[adopted new electoral strategies] by providing programmatic policy benefits such as national security among other candidates affiliated with LDP party, reducing promise of pork barrel goods and intra-party competition.

--

- Less research about testing how the electoral systems or the rules affect .hi-slate[inter-party and intra-party ideological positions] that legislators take in terms of legislative votings.

&nbsp;

### .hi-grey[Hypothesis Ⅰ] 

Switching from SNTV to SMDs mitigated the level of political polarization between parties, particularly between __.blue[KMT]__ (Chinese Nationalist Party) and __.green[DPP]__ (Democratic Progress Party).

--

### .hi-grey[Hypothesis ⅠⅠ]

Switching from __SNTV__ to __SMDs__ united co-partisan legislators in terms of ideological positions.

# .smaller[Inter-party Polarization]

&nbsp;

- To evaluate **the Hypothesis Ⅰ**, I calculate .hi-slate[the legislator-level inter-party dispersion] between two major parties, KMT and DPP (between party polarization). It is calculated as: 

$$\mathbf{interdistance_{it}=|position_{it}-\bar{whip_{it}|},}$$
--

- We specify the following regression model, allowing the passage of time (year) to have different marginal effects on inter-party ideological distance, prior to and post the electoral reform.

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{ interdistance_{it}=\alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1}electoralreform_{t}+\alpha_{2}year_{t}+} \\
\mathbf{\alpha_{3}(year_{t}\times electoralreform_{t})+C_{it}+\epsilon_{it}^{1},} \end{aligned}$$

$$\mathbf{intradistance_{it}=|position_{it}-whip_{it}|,}.$$

--

- The regression model is constructed as follow.

$$\begin{aligned} \mathbf{intradistance_{it}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}electoralreform_{t}+\beta_{2}year_{t}+}	\\
\mathbf{\beta_{3}(year_{t}\times electoralreform_{t})+\tilde{C}_{it}+\epsilon_{it}^{2},}\end{aligned}$$

# .smaller[Take-away]

name:take-away

&nbsp;

- Empirical results show that the reform not only .hi-slate[exacerbated] inter-party ideological polarization by distancing legislators’ positions from their opponents, but also .hi-slate[disunited co-partisan legislators] as their positions became more widely distributed along the ideological spectrum.


- This paper contributes to electoral reforms literature by adding empirical evidence .hi-slate[from Asian democracies] and highlights the ineffectiveness of using electoral reforms as means to alleviate political chaos.
